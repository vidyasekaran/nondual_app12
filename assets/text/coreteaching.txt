First, know that you are Conscious of yourself! In your ‘I am ness’ 
Consciousness only everything appears…happens and disappears too… 
Where does all form exist? Can any form exist when you are not 
Conscious of yourself? You come to know your existence as ‘I am ness’ 
only due to Consciousness within just now.!",
